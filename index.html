               <br />
               Every employee deserves to have their employment law rights respected throughout all stages of the employment relationship. At Taylor Janis LLP, our goal is to help you understand your legal rights for a variety of employment law issues, including wrongful dismissal, constructive dismissal, reasonable notice entitlements, severance, and just cause matters. Even if you have not made the decision yet to fully retain an employment lawyer, we can help simplify your problem, and give
               you the clear advice and direction you need in order to solve it. Whether you are facing a job loss, workplace harassment and discrimination, or any other employment-related matter, you need the services of an experienced employment lawyer to explain your rights and outline your options. Our goal is to resolve matters through a tactful negotiation, if possible, and by decisive and resolute litigation when it is not. If you think your employment law rights have been violated for
               any reason, there is a good chance that you are owed compensation for those violations. Let our experienced employment lawyers in Calgary & Edmonton help you find out how much compensation you are entitled to.
