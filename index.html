               <h4>What is a termination with just cause?</h4>
               <p>A just cause termination means that the employer has terminated your employment on the basis of serious misconduct that goes to the heart of your employment contract.</p>
               <br /><br />
               <h4>What is Constructive Dismissal?</h4>

               <br /><br />
               <h4>What constitutes as a wrongful dismissal?</h4>
               <p>Wrongful dismissal may occur when your employer terminates your employment, without respecting your legal rights.</p>

               <h3>Severance Pay</h3>
               <h4>What is Severance Pay?</h4>
               <p>Severance pay refers to the amount of money your employer must give you, the employee when your employment is terminated. This is often referred to as a "severance package", as it may include several aspects of your compensation.</p>
               <br /><br />
               <h4>Am I entitled to reasonable notice?</h4>

               <br /><br /><br />

               <h3>Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Clauses</h3>
               <h4>What are non-competition and non-solicitation clauses?</h4>
               <p>A non-competition clause stops the employee from working at a competitor for a certain number of months after separating from the company while a non-solicitation clause allows the employee to work anywhere, but with one caveat: they cannot solicit their former employer’s clients.</p>
               <br /><br />
               <h4>Are non-competition and non-solicitation clauses enforceable?</h4>
               <p>Both clauses will be unenforceable is if the employer wrongfully dismisses the employee.</p>

               <h3>Dependent Contractor</h3>
               <h4>Can I get severance if I was terminated as a dependent contractor?</h4>

               <br /><br />
               <p>If you are one of those people who believed the misconception and did not immediately bring a claim, all may not be lost: workers have two years from the date of their termination to bring a lawsuit.</p>
               <br /><br /><br />
